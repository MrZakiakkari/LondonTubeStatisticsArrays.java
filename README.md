# London Tube Statistics
## Example of Java Arrays

The Tube has been an integral part of London's history since 1863 and carry’s 1.34 billion passengers
a year. There are 270 stations on the 11 line network, with Waterloo being the busiest station
carrying 95.1 million passengers per year.
The following tabular data shows the number of passengers who entered 20 stations on a typical day
on the network in 2017. The table shows passenger numbers for January – June (inclusive) and July
– December (inclusive).
The table show entries for each of the 20 stations on a weekday, as well as Saturdays and Sundays.
You must write a Java application to do the following:
1. Represent the passenger information using a suitable data structure(s). You can generate
random values for the number of entries for each station. The values you generate must be
in the following ranges:
 A weekday (in the range 50000 to 140000)
 A Saturday (in the range 30000 to 80000)
 A Sunday (in the range 5000 to 15000)
2. Display the passenger information neatly (see the output from my solution below).
3. Calculate and display which station was the busiest across the entire year (displaying the
station name and the total number of passengers).
4. Calculate and display the percentage increase/decrease of passenger entries for each
station. This percentage value must be based on the difference in passenger entries
between both halves of the year. This value must be formatted to a maximum of two
decimal places.
A sample run of my solution yielded the following output.
You must have at least four methods (along with main) in your solution.
- Method one – to initialise the passenger information.
- Method two – to display the passenger information.
- Method three – to determine the busiest station.
- Method four – to calculate the percentage increase\decrease for each station.
